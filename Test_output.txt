NOTE: The messages printed to display the alarms after 5 seconds have been deleted in some cases
      to make the output easier to read

========================================================================================================================
Start_Alarm test with one alarm expiring soon. We expect the thread to print the
alarm, then remove the alarm once expired, then remove itself from the program:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 10 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710343762: 10 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710343762: 10 test1
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710343767: 10 test1
      Display Alarm Thread 0 Removed Expired Alarm(1) at 1710343772: 10 test1
      Display Alarm Thread 0 Exiting at 1710343772

Start_Alarm test with multiple threads. We expect multiple threads to be created
to handle the many alarms as they are inserted into the alarm list:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 90 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710343844: 90 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 1 Created at 1710343844: 90 test1
      Alarm > Start_Alarm(2): 90 test2
      Alarm 2 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710343850: 90 test2
      Alarm > Start_Alarm(3): 90 test3
      Alarm 3 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710343858: 90 test3
      New Display Alarm Thread 2 Created at 1710343858: 90 test3
      Alarm > Start_Alarm(4): 90 test4
      Alarm 4 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710343867: 90 test4
========================================================================================================================
Change_Alarm test. We expect alarm 1 to have the time "10" and message "new"
once the command is entered. We expect to see this the next time the thread
prints the alarm:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 60 original
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710382422: 60 original
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710382422: 60 original
      Alarm > Suspend_Alarm(1)
      Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710382427: 60 original
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Suspended at 1710382428: original
      Change_Alarm(1): 10 new
      Alarm (1) Changed at 1710382438: new
      Alarm > Reactivate_Alarm(1)
      Alarm (1) Reactivated at 1710382447: new
      Alarm > Display Thread 0 Starts to Print Changed Message at 1710382452: new
      Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710382452: 10 new
      Display Alarm Thread 0 Removed Expired Alarm(1) at 1710382457: 10 new
      Display Alarm Thread 0 Exiting at 1710382457
========================================================================================================================
Cancel_Alarm test. We expect the cancelled alarm to no longer print. We also
expect the alarm to be removed from the list by the thread, and the thread to
exit because all of its alarms are gone:

      Start_Alarm(1): 30 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710346804: 30 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 1 Created at 1710346804: 30 test1
      Alarm > Cancel_Alarm(1)
      Alarm > Display Alarm Thread (1) Removed Canceled Alarm(1) at 1710346807: test1
      Display Alarm Thread 1 Exiting at 1710346807

Cancel_Alarm test with multiple threads. We expect only the thread that owns
alarm 3 to cancel the alarm. The other threads should remain unaffected and the
thread that owns alarm 3 will remove the alarm.

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 60 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710349765: 60 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710349765: 60 test1
      Alarm > Start_Alarm(2): 60 test2
      Alarm 2 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710349773: 60 test2
      Alarm > Start_Alarm(3): 60 test3
      Alarm 3 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710349778: 60 test3
      New Display Alarm Thread 1 Created at 1710349778: 60 test3
      Alarm > Cancel_Alarm(3)
      Alarm > Display Alarm Thread (1) Removed Canceled Alarm(3) at 1710349783: test3
      Display Alarm Thread 1 Exiting at 1710349783
========================================================================================================================
Suspend_Alarm test. We expect the thread that owns alarm 1 to print out that it
has suspended the alarm. We expect the suspended alarm to no longer be printed
by the thread, which is the case in this output.

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 60 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710350365: 60 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710350365: 60 test1
      Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710350370: 60 test1
      Alarm > Suspend_Alarm(1)
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Suspended at 1710350371: test1

Suspend_Alarm test with multiple threads. We expect the other alarms to continue
to be printed and expire even though the suspended alarm does nothing. As shown,
alarms 2 and 3 print and expire while alarm 1 is suspended and neither prints
nor expires:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 10 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710372564: 10 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710372564: 10 test1
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710372569: 10 test1
      Suspend_Alarm(1)
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Suspended at 1710372570: test1
      Start_Alarm(2): 20 test2
      Alarm 2 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710372580: 20 test2
      Alarm > Alarm (2) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710372585: 20 test2

      Display Alarm Thread 1 Exiting at 1710372601
========================================================================================================================
Reactivate_Alarm test. We expect the alarm to be suspended and stop printing
while it is suspended. Once reactivated, we expect the alarm to resume printing
and eventually expire, as if nothing had happened:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 40 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710360274: 40 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710360274: 40 test1
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710360279: 40 test1

      Reactivate_Alarm(1)
      Alarm (1) Reactivated at 1710360309: test1
      Alarm > Alarm (1) Printed by Alarm Display Thread 0 at 1710360314: 40 test1

      Display Alarm Thread 0 Removed Expired Alarm(1) at 1710360325: 40 test1
      Display Alarm Thread 0 Exiting at 1710360325

Reactivate_Alarm test with multiple threads. We expect the thread that has alarm
3 to keep the alarm suspended even as other threads and alarms continue to print
and expire. The thread keeps alarm 3 until we reactivate it, where it prints and
eventually expires:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 9 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710374052: 9 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710374052: 9 test1

      Alarm > Alarm (1) Suspended at 1710374056: test1

========================================================================================================================
View_Alarms test. We expect one thread to print one alarm:

      Alarm > Start_Alarm(1): 19 test1
      Alarm 1 Inserted Into Alarm List at 1710374750: 19 test1
      New Display Alarm Thread 0 Created at 1710374750: 19 test1

      Alarm > Display Thread 0 Assigned:

View_Alarms test with multiple threads. We expect each thread to print each of
their alarms:
